# 🎓 Consult University Website

This is a simple university website project created as a homework assignment during my HTML and CSS learning phase. The project files structure is somewhat disorganized, but the website works without any issues.

## 📝 Project Description

- The website was built using basic **HTML** and **CSS**.  
- The folder and file structure is not perfectly organized since it was created during early learning stages.  
- The website **does not support responsive design**, as I had not yet learned how to implement responsiveness at the time.  
- Despite this, the site functions correctly on desktop browsers.

## ✨ Features

- Basic university website layout  
- Simple navigation and content sections  
- No responsive design support (desktop only)  
- Good practice for foundational HTML and CSS skills

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and content  
- **CSS3** – Styling without responsiveness

## 🚀 How to Run

Open the main HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) in a desktop web browser to view the website.
